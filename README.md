Solve the riddle until you run out of guesses!

The game is a clone of Wordle and made with localization in mind.

## ⚙️ Installing

Since this app is still under development, there are no stable builds. But you
still have an option to run the app from source.

There are two options how to do it:

- Run the app from [GNOME Builder](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gnome.Builder)
- Use the following commands to build it with Meson:

```sh
meson _build
sudo meson install -C _build
```
